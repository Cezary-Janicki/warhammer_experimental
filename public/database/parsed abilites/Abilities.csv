Those Necrons too catastrophically damaged to reform vanish instead, teleported away to their tombs for repair.|false|NEC|Each time an enemy unit shoots or fights, after it makes its attacks, if any models in this unit were destroyed as a result of those attacks but this unit was not destroyed, this unit's reanimation protocols are enacted and those destroyed models begin to reassemble.Each time a unit's reanimation protocols are enacted, make Reanimation Protocol rolls for that unit by rolling a number of D6 equal to the combined Wounds characteristics of all the reassembling models. Each Reanimation Protocol roll of 5+ is put into a pool. A Reanimation Protocol roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.If the number of dice in that pool is greater than or equal to the Wounds characteristic of any of the reassembling models, select one of those models to be Reanimated. A Reanimated model:Is added back to its unit with its full wounds remaining.Can only set up within Engagement Range of enemy units that are already within Engagement Range of the Reanimated model's unit.Cannot, if it is your Charge phase, be set up closer to any enemy units that are targets of a charge declared by its unit this phase.No longer counts as having been destroyed for the purposes of Morale tests this turn.You then reduce the number of dice in that pool by a number equal to the Wounds characteristic of the Reanimated model and repeat this process until either there are no more reassembling models, or the number of dice remaining in the pool is less than the Wounds characteristic of any of the reassembling models. Any models that did not Reanimate fail to reassemble, and any dice remaining in the pool are discarded.Example: In the Shooting phase, an enemy unit targets and makes its attacks against a 5-strong unit of Lychguard, destroying 3 models and leaving another with only one wound left. The Lychguard units reanimation protocols are enacted, and you now make Reanimation Protocol rolls for it. Each Lychguard has a Wounds characteristic of 2, so you would roll a total of six D6s. If you rolled 1, 3, 4, 5, 5 and 6, you would put three dice into a pool. This pool contains enough dice to Reanimate one of the destroyed models, and so it is set back up on the battlefield. After that model has been Reanimated, there is only one dice remaining in your pool. This is not enough to Reanimate another reassembling Lychguard model, as it is less than the models Wounds characteristic; this dice is therefore discarded.|

To do so, you will use Miracle dice.Gaining Miracle DiceIf every unit from your army has the ADEPTA SORORITAS keyword (excluding models with the CULT IMPERIALIS, AGENT OF THE IMPERIUM or UNALIGNED keywords), then:At the start of each turn, you gain 1 Miracle dice.At the end of a phase in which any of the following conditions were met, you gain 1 Miracle dice:VengeanceAny ADEPTA SORORITAS units from your army destroy one or more enemy units.SacrificeAny ADEPTA SORORITAS CHARACTER units from your army are destroyed.Note that Miracle dice can also be gained via other rules. No matter the source, you can only gain Miracle dice from such a rule if every unit from your army has the ADEPTA SORORITAS keyword (excluding models with the CULT IMPERIALIS, AGENT OF THE IMPERIUM or UNALIGNED keywords).Each time you gain a Miracle dice, roll one D6. The number you roll is the value of that Miracle dice. This value cannot be changed or re-rolled, unless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your Miracle dice to one side - this is your Miracle dice pool.Designer’s Note: We recommend using differently coloured or marked dice for your Miracle dice pool, and placing them to one side of the battle.field, or some place else where you will not accidentally pick them up midgame. It is perfectly fine, if you wish, to write down the values of the Miracle dice in your pool, or to keep track of them in any other way, just so long as both players can see them.Performing an Act of FaithBefore making a dice roll for a model or a unit from your army with the Acts of Faith ability, if you have one or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can perform an Act of Faith. To do so, select one or more of the dice from your Miracle dice pool, instead of making any or all of those dice rolls. For each individual dice that is being rolled as part of the dice roll, you can select 1 Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool to be substituted in place of that dice. The dice that it is being substituted for is not rolled, and instead the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled. Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll any remaining, unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:Advance rollCharge rollHit rollWound rollSaving throwDamage rollMorale testA Miracle dice is not a modifier or an inherently modified dice (so, for example, if you use a Miracle dice with a value of 1 for a Morale test, that is considered to be an unmodified roll of 1). A Miracle dice that has been used for a substitution can never be re-rolled. This means that if any re-rolls occur, the number and values of any Miracle dice that have already been substituted in the dice roll remain the same for the re-roll (for example, if a single Miracle dice was used to substitute one of the values of a charge roll, and the charge roll was re-rolled, only the unsubstituted dice can be re-rolled).Example 1: Instead of rolling one D6 to see what value is added to a unit’s Move characteristic when that unit Advances, you could use a dice from your Miracle dice pool.

000004698|Abilities|Command Protocols|The Necron nobility make war in a codified and relentless fashion.

He selects the following, writing them down on his army roster:Battle Round 1 = 2 (Sudden Storm)Battle Round 2 = 3 (Vengeful Stars)Battle Round 3 = 5 (Undying Legions)Battle Round 4 = 4 (Hungry Void)Battle Round 5+ = 1 (Eternal Guardian)Designers Note: If you have a set of Necrons Datacards, you can instead assign your command protocols by selecting the five corresponding cards you wish to use and placing them in a face-down deck in an order such that - by turning over the top card at the start of each battle round - you reveal the command protocol that will be active for your army that battle round.At the start of each battle round, if any NECRONS CHARACTER units from your army are on the battlefield, the command protocol that you assigned to that battle round becomes active for your army until the end of that battle round. Each command protocol is made up of two directives. When a command protocol becomes active for your army, reveal it to your opponent and select one of its directives. Until the assigned command protocol stops being active, while a unit that is eligible to benefit from this ability is on the battlefield, that unit benefits from the selected directive.In addition, if all units from your army are from the same dynasty (excluding DYNASTIC AGENT, C’TAN SHARD and UNALIGNED units), select one command protocol that has not been assigned to a battle round (there will typically only be one). That command protocol is active in every battle round in addition to the one assigned to that battle round – select which directive your units will benefit from at the start of each battle round. Note that if this additional command protocol is the one described in your dynasty’s code, this means both of its directives apply to all units with this ability in your army in every battle round, in addition to the protocol assigned to that battle round. The available command protocols are shown below.Designer’s Note: Some rules refer to ‘the active command protocol’, in these instances these rules refer to all command protocols that are active for your army.$Table$|

Instead, for each point of damage inflicted, one of its void shields loses 1 shield point. Once a void shield has lost a shield point, it must continue to lose shield points due to any further damage inflicted until it collapses. Each time an attack causes a void shield to be reduced to 0 shield points, that void shield collapses: this model loses that void shield and any excess damage inflicted by that attack is lost. Void shields can never be used to prevent mortal wounds (each mortal wound inflicted on a model with void shields causes that model to lose one wound as normal).At the start of your Command phase, if this model has a void shield that has fewer than 3 shield points remaining, that void shield is restored to 3 shield points.|

Note this down secretly on your army roster.In each of your Command phases, so long as one is available, you must select one ka’tah stance to become active for your army. Each time you do so, units from your army with this ability benefit from it until the start of your next Command phase. When selecting a ka’tah stance to become active, the following rules apply:You cannot select a ka’tah stance more than once.You must select a primary ka’tah stance first, and you cannot select a tertiary ka’tah stance until you have selected a secondary ka’tah stance.Once you select a stance of a different martial ka’tah, you cannot select a stance of a previous martial ka’tah.Example: Every model in Emily’s army has the ADEPTUS CUSTODES keyword. She selects Rendax as her primary ka’tah, Dacatarai as her secondary ka’tah and Calistus as her tertiary ka’tah. In her first command phase, she selects Rendax stance 2 to be active.In her second Command phase, she can select Rendax stance 1 to be active, or she can instead select Dacatarai stance 1 or 2 to be active, as she has previously selected a primary ka’tah stance. She cannot select a Calistus stance, as she must select a secondary ka’tah’s stance before she can select a tertiary ka’tah’s stance. She selects Dacatarai stance 1 to be active.In her third Command phase, she can select Dacatarai stance 2 to be active, or she can instead select Calistus stance 1 or 2 to be active, as she has previously selected a secondary ka’tah stance. She cannot select Rendax stance 1, as she cannot select a stance of a previous ka’tah. She selects Calistus stance 2 to be active.In her fourth Command phase, she must select Calistus stance 1 to be active, as it is the only remaining stance she is able to select. Note that this means in the fifth Command phase, there would be no ka’tah stances available to her, so she does not select one.|
