This is a project. I am currently working on. It's a damage calculator for a tabletop wargame Warhammer 40 000. 
The damage dealt in agame by various units is heavily decided by random chance. 
This project's goal is helping players making better informed decision inthe game. Currently, the project is hosted at https://warhammer-40k.vercel.app
